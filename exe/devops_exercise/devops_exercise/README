# EXERCISE README #



The exercise consists in parsing a bunch of log entries and calculate some simple statistics based on those entries.


The candidate may use any preferred programming/scripting language (and third party libraries).


The solution must have tests. 

Inside the folder there is a text file containing the log entries: 
devops_logs.txt
 The entries have the following format:


timestamp "http_method http_request http_version" http_status response_time response_size route_length

* 'timestamp' is Unix timestamp
* 'response_time' is measured in microseconds
* 'response_size' is measured in bytes
* 'route_length' is measured in meters

If one value is missing it is reported as '-'.



The requests are categorized in 4 different categories:

* shortroute (for routes < 100 km)
* longroute (for routes >=100 km and <1000 km)
* verylongroute (for routes >=1000 km)
* other (all the other routes).



Please create a folder called 'src'. 
Inside this folder put your source code and tests. 

Add a file called INSTRUCTIONS if special instructions are needed to run/test your code.



Please write a code which should calculate the following statistics:


1) The number of request for each route category (shortroute, longroute, verylongroute, other).

2) The average response time, the standard deviation and the 98th percentile of the response time for the    shortroute requests category. All values should be in milliseconds.

3) The max route length present in the dataset.

The output of your code must be a json file called ‘result.json’    with the results.
For the file format please refer to the 'result.json' file present in this folder
